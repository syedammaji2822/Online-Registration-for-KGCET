            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>The college owes its existence to the keen interest of Late Kandula Obul Reddy to develop technical education in Rayalaseema region of Andhra Pradesh. With a view to translating his noble ideal of imparting technical education into reality, a Technical Training Institute at Vempalli, Kadapa District was started in 1979 under the aegis of Sri Kandula Obul Reddy charities. It is in the year 1980 that K.S.R.M. College of Engineering was established to perpetuate the memory of Late Sri. Kandula Srinivasa Reddy, youngest son of Late Sri Kandula Obul Reddy. Sri Kandula Srinivasa Reddy, a brilliantstudent of III year Mechanical Engineering at Delhi College of Engineering, New Delhi, met with his untimely death in a scooter accident on 18th Oct, 1979.</p>

            <p>The college was formally inaugurated on 14 November 1980 by Sri T. Anjaiah, the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh and it started functioning from the academic year 1980-81.</p>
